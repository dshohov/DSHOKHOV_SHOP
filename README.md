## Why was this project developed?
The project was created for practical experience in writing full-fledged web applications. For learning new technologies and for implementing APIs that are interesting to me. This tutorial project helped me delve deeper into the back-end development process.

## Sources
In terms of design, the project was inspired by online stores: Asos, Zara, Mango. In terms of that, let me name an online store, it is only because it is very in demand, more and more people want to have their own business and therefore this is a niche in demand. Also, during development, you can encounter many interesting problems that need to be solved.
